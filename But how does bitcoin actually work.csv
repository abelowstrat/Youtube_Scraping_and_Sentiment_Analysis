3Blue1Brown;If you see comments here about investing or brokers, they are scams.  Videos about cryptocurrencies, evidently including ones that are just about the underlying technology/math, are hotbeds for attracting nefarious actors preying on the impressionable.Also, hi!  If you‚Äôre new to this channel, most of it is about visualizing math. I get it, you probably landed here searching for how BTC works, not to spend your afternoon getting pulled into learning about, say, prime numbers or problem-solving, but if you have a moment take a look at the rest of the channel, you may enjoy what you find.;8.2K;1 year ago (edited)

Tushar Menon;at around 20:30,  theyre discussing how it isnt viable for Alice to try to commit fraud because she cant out-compute the other miners on the network all by herself. could someone explain what would happen if a group of miners (that formed the majority of the network) decide to commit fraud together?;143;4 years ago
;It's 100% possible.  And in fact, the top 4 miners of bitcoin have more than 50% of the network's total hashing power.  However, if you have 50% of the total mining network's computation, you're probably better off using it to make ~$2.2 Million a day with honest mining than you to defraud a single individual.;250;4 years ago

OOO;"I believe it'll be the same if certain amount of 1s have to be achieved. Starting 0's are just a universal way to find the proof-of-work. If instead an arbitrary string of bits is used/generated as ""the password"", there will need an additional mechanism to check the validity of the proof-of-work.";3;3 months ago
James Matthew;The number of 0's is the mining difficulty. Less miners would mean a key with fewer 0's is required. That's how a rate of 1 block per 10 minutes is maintained regardless of mining pool size.;1;3 months ago
Mike Fochtman;The '30 zeros' I believe is just arbitrary.  But all miners and users have to agree that a valid block will have SOMETHING that is easily checked.   If everyone agrees that the first 30 bits must be '10101010.....' the system would still have worked.  And I suppose all zeros is as simple as any other pattern.They mention that the actual number of zeros needed has changed over time as computational power of 'miners' has grown.  So now it's more than that, designed to keep the average time to verify/hash a block to about 10 minutes.;;2 months ago

Make use of thespacehackersComüëàüèª;The regular lending rates on FTX are quite good compared to most banks, but they fluctuate by the hour (and also intra-hour, but you're generally not paid for that). Meanwhile staking is a set yearly amount that seldom changes, but then you have to find a good entry and bare the risk that entails. On the other hand, I consider the opportunity cost of not owning crypto these days to be much of a much higher risk. That is to say, I think _not _owning crypto is far more risky than owning it, due to various things not limited to stupid fiscal policies and Fed money printing. So the best is owing it, trading and investing with it, I learned that from a crypto expert from TheSpaceHackers‚®ÄCom I've made tons of profits btw;2;4 months ago
Alberto T.;Something that should be obvious to any computer scientist: This is terrible in practice. It wastes the same amount of energy every 10 minutes regardless of how many transactions are there. This amount of energy is only decided by how much energy miners want to waste: the answer is as much as possible, while still having a profit. So every 10 minutes miners can spend 6 bitcoins worth of electricity and still have profit (0.25 btc). The more expensive crypto gets, the more energy it will waste.;10;4 months ago
Rrestoring faith;"@Alberto T.  Yeah, it's not scalable.Note that proof of work is one solution to the problem; there are many other ways of doing it. (Ex/ proof of time, proof of stake, proof of burn, etc...). Also, if the amount of time was reduced to say 0.01 seconds instead of 10 minutes to make it more practical, there will be too many forks & network spam.The blockchain itself also has poor scalability, though, considering that transactions from a single individual are spread out and all stored separately. It is a neat idea. There are just too many downsides.";5;4 months ago (edited)
Khaled Ratul; @Tobi  I'd probably go with centralized and regulated currencies because they seem way less volatile, reliable and secure.

Crabby Hayes;"Thank you so much for this very informative video. The block chain methodology appears to have devised a way to ensure secure transactions; and people smarter people than me have likely answered most of the objections, I guess I remain skeptical. I base this on nothing more than human nature, greed, and the ability of people with personal motives to somehow work the system to their own benefit. For example, why couldn't a clever programmer just place 30 zeroes - followed by a random number set at the end of his block chain (after inserting his payoff), then replacate a large number of these pseudo-blocks and rapidly distribute them in quantity to an unsuspecting world? And, Bob's your uncle, and Bitcoin becomes another Magino Line to be circumvented.";;2 months ago
Theo Pantamis;"The hash is computed not ""placed"". When other check the block is valid, they take its header, which commit to the whole content of the block, computes the hash of block's header and it must be a low number. Their is no way to build a block with a low hash other than try random stuff because the result of a hash function also looks random.The clever programmer will never be able to set the hash as he wishes, he can only set the block content then compute the hash to see if it is a low number, if not try again with another block content...";;1 month ago
Crabby Hayes; @Theo Pantamis  Sorry my example was more of a Gordian Knot analogy than a technical statement. Recall no one could solve the puzzle, until Alexander the Great used his sword to cut the rope - problem solved. Given enough time and financial incentive, I suspect just about any problem can be solved in a similar fashion.;;1 month ago
Theo Pantamis;" @Crabby Hayes  And this is expected ! The puzzle is made so that someone solves it every 10 minutes. If it is solved too fast, its difficulty is increased to keep it that way in average.However, if you mean that there is maybe a way to ""break"" SHA256 so that mining is not a brut-force puzzle anymore then notice that note only Bitcoin is in danger, but all the signature and integrity check algorithms used in the world too ! (in finance, web certificates, communication...)  Changing the hash function is also not impossible in this extreme case, it is just painful technically, nullifying all the effort.That's is where your analogy with Gordian Knot is limited: the rope is static but mining is actually a dynamical problem that can adapt itself to the ones who try to solve it. It said to be anti-fragile.";;1 month ago

Matthew Snee;Prior to watching this I didn't really understand the link between mining and validating the transactions. Its quite interesting how the system can self-adjust to make sure that mining\validating is always profitable, and therefore even if there is a big crash in mining profitability it should just result in a slowdown of transactions until the system balances. I guess the issue is that there is a big problem if the coin is used for real large scale commerce\business that rely on guaranteed volume. If a large enough proportion of bitcoin transactions were for real vital goods and services, then a crash in mining profitability could drive he value to zero since the value would be much more tied to the amount of volume the system can handle. Lack of trust could continually inflate it, which would then continually make it harder to restore validation capacity. Volatility is an issue for real world business even if the overall trend is continually upwards. If I am correct, then it would suggest that bitcoin will remain a speculation asset and a store of value rather than a replacement for sovereign currencies?;27;5 months ago
Alberto T.;Yes, even if it was stable it would be deflationary, and a deflationary currency is a very, very bad currency. Another problem is that it's incredibly wasteful, and already contributing to climate change to a level that can appear in charts. It will only get worse the higher the price is, because miners can afford to use more electricity.;14;4 months ago
Chem Man Dan; @Alberto T.   Incorrect. The majority of energy used for Bitcoin mining is already from renewable energy sources. In terms of profit potential, bitcoin mining is designed in such a way that implicitly requires the necessity for cheap, renewable forms of energy production. And thus, Bitcoin mining actually incentivizes the need for advancements in technology for renewables and that is exactly what is currently being done. We will look back on this one day and realize that something as controversial as bitcoin mining turned out to be the technological catalyst the planet needed all along.;8;4 months ago
Arthur Kania; @Alberto T.  And what about inflationary currencies?  There may be unforeseen consequences due to the energy expenditure, but I feel that pales in comparison to the gymnastics that fiat currencies have given rise too.  If the result is sound money that prevents the manipulation of central banks, then it might be a price worth paying.  Just food for thought.  Governments WILL use the climate as an excuse to restrict access to private citizens' crypto.I agree we need better energy solutions though.

Johnny W;"Amazing video. Definitely the best I've ever seen on Block Chain. I actually feel I kind of understand it now, which is incredible.However I still don't understand how the order of the transactions (which could surely lead to someone spending money they don't have, if the ledger placed them in the wrong order) is mitigated by the ""always follow the block chain with the most computation behind it"" methodology.And also what happens if someone trusts a block chain that's later replaced by another. (I mean I know the video says that you should wait for a few blocks to follow to ensure you can trust it, but there must be occasional holes in that method where a trusted line suddenly has gotten replaced?).";14;1 year ago
big clover;"I'm not sure if this will exactly answer your question, but transactions don't really have an ""order"". Whenever you make one, you are really putting it into a pool of transactions waiting to be confirmed (which happens by the transactions being put down on blocks by miners at some point. And yes, miners get to choose which transactions they put on a block, but they can't ever put one down that was already on a previous block). You wouldn't be able to spend money you didn't have, because you wouldn't have the money until the transaction giving you the money was confirmed. Really, the order of transactions confirmed shouldn't matter at all, when adding new blocks. I feel like this is something 3Blue1Brown misses in his video, because it's a little bit unclear that he means computational methodology sets the order, not that transactions are put down in the same order as they are requested. Following proof of work is just a way to keep everyone synced up. For your second question, (and I'm not an expert so take this with a grain of salt), in an ordinary situation, multiple block chains usually aren't created. If two miners happen to create different blocks chaining off the same original block, the one that was created first will be accepted, and there would only be one chain to continue with. The miner with the losing block doesn't receive any extra currency for their efforts, and their block is discarded.If you're thinking of his example with a fraudulent block, other miners don't see the fraudulent one, so they will never add onto it. This means, as said in the video, someone creating a fraudulent block would be the only one adding onto it. This means they would have to consistently out-compete all the other miners, time-wise, in order to get their fraudulent chain accepted. Think of being the fastest one to create a block as winning a lottery. Continuously being the fastest one would be like winning the lottery over and over. The number of blocks required to select one chain as the valid one is simply a number where the chance of winning the lottery that many times would essentially be 0. While theoretically, someone could slip through with a fraudulent chain, they'd have to be impossibly lucky. Of course, if you had a computer that could somehow process numbers a VERY significant amount faster than the leading technology now, that would change...";13;1 year ago (edited)
Daniel Cawley;In the bitcoin blockchain once a block is mined it takes 100 blocks following for the miner to be able to access their coins, so after 100 blocks (which is about 16 hours and 40 minutes) that block is seen to be valid and in the valid blockchain.;2;5 months ago

As soon as 256 bit hash collisions come into the public view like it did for SHA-1 just a few years ago the ledger will start suffering from fake transactions.  Then you might as well hire people to watch these transactions manually.  Maybe get some type of insurance on losses.  Then maybe realize that all vulneribilities from the hardware layer to the software layer means you can lose all your money so setup a system to ensure the key exchange is secure, like a network of quantum key exchanges.

Nikolaos Mark;Can you tell me the synopsis of how Bitcoin actually generates money/wealth? By solving math in short? But for who and why this generates wealth?;6;1 year ago (edited)
Zolt√°n K√ºrti; @Erdem Memisyazici  I have no fucking clue what a quintillion is, use scientific notation for big numbers, normie. But whatever you mean by 52 quintillion, it's probably less than a second in planck units. That's like 10^43 hashes per second. There is a huge gap between 128 and 256 bit hashes. 128 bit hashes have 2^128 possibilities. Now if you have 2^128 additional possibilities for each possibility of the original 128bit hash, you have the 256 bit hash. It's just ridiculously larger.;9;1 year ago

Sagar Tyagi;Hey, thanks for the awesome tutorial. I have 1 question, can it happen that a true transaction gets rejected?;1;7 months ago
James Edington;It would happen if no miners included your transaction in their block (for example, if you were offering such a small transaction fee that they always had juicier choices- generally, only between 1600 and 2200 transactions fit in each block). When this happens, you have a few options: wait for the next block and try again, increase your bid to try to get a miner to pick your transaction up this block, or look into other options (like cash, debit, another cryptocurrency, or experimental off-chain resolution that some programmers are trying to work on);;6 months ago
JMacSD;"Depends what you mean by ""true transaction"". Bitcoin is not actually used as a currency because your transaction has to include a big tip to miners or they won't put it in a block. The above comment discusses this also.It can happen that a true transaction (one that makes it into a block) gets (partially) rejected, but it's extremely rare and unlikely. It's called a fork when some nodes on the network accept the latest block, others don't, yielding effectively 2 blockchains that can grow.";;4 months ago

Rizki Rahmanda;first of all, a really cool video, thank you 3Blue1Brown, always dependable. But I want to ask, how did the hash 256 function created? my understanding is, there has to be someone that create the function right? and when he create it, he knew the algorithm on how to reverse engineering it. and if yes there is a person / company that create that, didnt they can be able to exploit the system by always finding the hash earlier than others due to they have the key to understand the hash algorithm?thank you;;4 months ago
Rrestoring faith;It is made by the NSA.If there is a known way to reverse-engineer it, then it would not be a good hash function and would not be used. If it were broken, a lot more than just bitcoin would become vulnerable.Can try it yourself.;2;4 months ago
Daniel Cawley;If sha-256 is insecure its not just a problem for bitcoin, it is a problem for everything - governments & banks use this hashing system so if there was a security vulnerability loads of important info in the world would be compromised, so you shouldn't worry about bitcoin relying on a certain hashing function since everything relies on this one hashing function.;;4 months ago
