For example, why couldn't a clever programmer just place 30 zeroes - followed by a random number set at the end of his block chain (after inserting his payoff), then replacate a large number of these pseudo-blocks and rapidly distribute them in quantity to an unsuspecting world?

Its quite interesting how the system can self-adjust to make sure that mining\\\\validating is always profitable, and therefore even if there is a big crash in mining profitability it should just result in a slowdown of transactions until the system balances. I guess the issue is that there is a big problem if the coin is used for real large scale commerce\\\\business that rely on guaranteed volume. If a large enough proportion of bitcoin transactions were for real vital goods and services, then a crash in mining profitability could drive he value to zero since the value would be much more tied to the amount of volume the system can handle. Lack of trust could continually inflate it, which would then continually make it harder to restore validation capacity.

       " 'Amazing video. Definitely the best I\\'ve ever seen on Block Chain. I actually feel I kind of understand it now, which is incredible.\\n\\nHowever I still don\\'t understand how the order of the transactions (which could surely lead to someone spending money they don\\'t have, if the ledger placed them in the wrong order) is mitigated by the \"always follow the block chain with the most computation behind it\" methodology.\\n\\nAnd also what happens if someone trusts a block chain that\\'s later replaced by another. (I mean I know the video says that you should wait for a few blocks to follow to ensure you can trust it, but there must be occasional holes in that method where a trusted line suddenly has gotten replaced?).',\n",
       " 'I\\'m not sure if this will exactly answer your question, but transactions don\\'t really have an \"order\". Whenever you make one, you are really putting it into a pool of transactions waiting to be confirmed (which happens by the transactions being put down on blocks by miners at some point. And yes, miners get to choose which transactions they put on a block, but they can\\'t ever put one down that was already on a previous block). You wouldn\\'t be able to spend money you didn\\'t have, because you wouldn\\'t have the money until the transaction giving you the money was confirmed. Really, the order of transactions confirmed shouldn\\'t matter at all, when adding new blocks. \\nI feel like this is something 3Blue1Brown misses in his video, because it\\'s a little bit unclear that he means computational methodology sets the order, not that transactions are put down in the same order as they are requested. Following proof of work is just a way to keep everyone synced up. \\n\\nFor your second question, (and I\\'m not an expert so take this with a grain of salt), in an ordinary situation, multiple block chains usually aren\\'t created. If two miners happen to create different blocks chaining off the same original block, the one that was created first will be accepted, and there would only be one chain to continue with. The miner with the losing block doesn\\'t receive any extra currency for their efforts, and their block is discarded.\\nIf you\\'re thinking of his example with a fraudulent block, other miners don\\'t see the fraudulent one, so they will never add onto it. This means, as said in the video, someone creating a fraudulent block would be the only one adding onto it. This means they would have to consistently out-compete all the other miners, time-wise, in order to get their fraudulent chain accepted. Think of being the fastest one to create a block as winning a lottery. Continuously being the fastest one would be like winning the lottery over and over. The number of blocks required to select one chain as the valid one is simply a number where the chance of winning the lottery that many times would essentially be 0. While theoretically, someone could slip through with a fraudulent chain, they\\'d have to be impossibly lucky. Of course, if you had a computer that could somehow process numbers a VERY significant amount faster than the leading technology now, that would change...',\n",

Its quite interesting how the system can self-adjust to make sure that mining\\\\validating is always profitable, and therefore even if there is a big crash in mining profitability it should just result in a slowdown of transactions until the system balances. I guess the issue is that there is a big problem if the coin is used for real large scale commerce\\\\business that rely on guaranteed volume. If a large enough proportion of bitcoin transactions were for real vital goods and services, then a crash in mining profitability could drive he value to zero since the value would be much more tied to the amount of volume the system can handle. Lack of trust could continually inflate it, which would then continually make it harder to restore validation capacity.

The majority of energy used for Bitcoin mining is already from renewable energy sources.

Definitely the best I\\'ve ever seen on Block Chain. I actually feel I kind of understand it now, which is incredible.\\n\\nHowever I still don\\'t understand how the order of the transactions (which could surely lead to someone spending money they don\\'t have, if the ledger placed them in the wrong order) is mitigated by the \"always follow the block chain with the most computation behind it\" methodology.\\n\\nAnd also what happens if someone trusts a block chain that\\'s later replaced by another. (I mean I know the video says that you should wait for a few blocks to follow to ensure you can trust it, but there must be occasional holes in that method where a trusted line suddenly has gotten replaced?).', 'I\\'m not sure if this will exactly answer your question, but transactions don\\'t really have an \"order\". Whenever you make one, you are really putting it into a pool of transactions waiting to be confirmed (which happens by the transactions being put down on blocks by miners at some point. And yes, miners get to choose which transactions they put on a block, but they can\\'t ever put one down that was already on a previous block). You wouldn\\'t be able to spend money you didn\\'t have, because you wouldn\\'t have the money until the transaction giving you the money was confirmed. Really, the order of transactions confirmed shouldn\\'t matter at all, when adding new blocks. \\nI feel like this is something 3Blue1Brown misses in his video, because it\\'s a little bit unclear that he means computational methodology sets the order, not that transactions are put down in the same order as they are requested. Following proof of work is just a way to keep everyone synced up. \\n\\nFor your second question, (and I\\'m not an expert so take this with a grain of salt), in an ordinary situation, multiple block chains usually aren\\'t created. If two miners happen to create different blocks chaining off the same original block, the one that was created first will be accepted, and there would only be one chain to continue with. The miner with the losing block doesn\\'t receive any extra currency for their efforts, and their block is discarded.\\nIf you\\'re thinking of his example with a fraudulent block, other miners don\\'t see the fraudulent one, so they will never add onto it. This means, as said in the video, someone creating a fraudulent block would be the only one adding onto it. This means they would have to consistently out-compete all the other miners, time-wise, in order to get their fraudulent chain accepted. Think of being the fastest one to create a block as winning a lottery. Continuously being the fastest one would be like winning the lottery over and over. The number of blocks required to select one chain as the valid one is simply a number where the chance of winning the lottery that many times would essentially be 0. While theoretically, someone could slip through with a fraudulent chain, they\\'d have to be impossibly lucky. Of course, if you had a computer that could somehow process numbers a VERY significant amount faster than the leading technology now, that would change...', 'In the bitcoin blockchain once a block is mined it takes 100 blocks following for the miner to be able to access their coins, so after 100 blocks (which is about 16 hours and 40 minutes) that block is seen to be valid and in the valid blockchain.', 'I love how you subtly touched P vs. NP in the process:)', '📞📲📩', 'probably one of the best explanations of the blockchain that i have seen', 'Best video on block chain.
